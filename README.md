# Generic-Sorting-Function-in-C
This program uses the concept of polymorphism to use a function in the standard library (qsort) for sorting various data types. 
qsort takes four parameters
  * first parameter: array of any type 
  * second parameter: size of array 
  * third parameter: size of data elements in array 
  * fourth parameter: pointer to comparater function 


## Learning Outcome 
Generic functions are very useful when implementing programs that can handle the same set of tasks for various data types. 
For instance, in this program we created a single sorting algorithm that can sort strings, floats, and integers. 
This can be effective for an imperative programming language such as C since programmers have to 
define data types explicitly in many cases.
